# ImageClassification-kNN-SVM
This repository is related to Computer Vision course purposes at ECE, DUTH.


In this work, I focused on image classification using k-NN and SVM classifiers, dealing with multi-class classification. The project involved training with the 'imagedb' image database and testing with 'imagedb_test' to evaluate the algorithms' performance. Key steps included creating a visual dictionary based on the "Bag of Visual Words" model, implementing the k-NN classifier and the one-vs-all scheme for the SVM classifier, and calculating the accuracy of algorithms both overall and for each class, also exploring the effects of increasing nearest neighbors and the size of the visual dictionary on accuracy.
